 Steps to achieve this with string manipulation:

 1. Extract the components of the POS expression
 2. For each component, add the remaining components (original and complementary variable). Note that this insertion must not affect the order given by the variables so it is sorted in each insertion. All component are different to avoid redudancy.
 3. Sort the components as they were in a truth table.
 4. Display them appropiately.
